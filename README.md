# Project Title: Data Science Job Trends Analysis

# Objective:
This is a guided project used To analyze a dataset of over 32,000 job postings related to data science roles. The goal is to uncover key hiring trends, salary insights, remote work prevalence, skill demands, and job distribution across regions and job types.

# Problem Statement:
With the data science field growing rapidly, job seekers and recruiters face difficulty identifying market demands, fair salary expectations, and in-demand skills. This project solves the problem by offering a data-driven overview of the data science job market.


# Problem Solved:
- Identified top job roles in demand (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer).
- Analyzed average annual and hourly salaries across job titles and locations.
- Measured how often jobs are remote or require a degree.
- Revealed the most in-demand technical skills (e.g., Python, SQL, AWS).
- Determined job posting patterns over time and locations.

# Key Insights:
- **Top Job Titles**: "Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer" lead in frequency.
- **Remote Jobs**: A significant number of jobs offer work-from-home flexibility.
- **Degree Requirement**: Many job listings do **not** explicitly require a degree.
- **High-Demand Skills**: Python, SQL, AWS, and Tableau are consistently in top job skills.
- **Salary Ranges**: U.S.-based roles offer higher average yearly salaries, often exceeding $120,000.
- **Job Distribution**: Jobs are highly concentrated in tech hubs like New York, Texas, and California.


# Conclusion:
This project provides valuable guidance to job seekers, recruiters, and educators in the data science field. By using this data, stakeholders can align their efforts with real-world demand—whether it’s acquiring relevant skills, setting salary expectations, or targeting the right job market.
